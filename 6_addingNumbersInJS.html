  There are a few gotchas with this one in JS. 
  1 is to make sure that you dealing with Number types as opposed to strings.
    This can be done with +prefix or Number()
  2 is that JS, just like Java, PHP, Ruby, and C have floating point numbers, aka
    Double, aka IEEE-754. So we deal with that with the toFixed() method at the 
    end of the sum. the parameter tells us with how many decimal points of precision
    we force it to.
